### Severity Levels

#### 🔴 Critical
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection with data access
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to admin

#### 🟠 High
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Local file inclusion
- Sensitive data exposure
- CSRF with significant impact

#### 🟡 Medium
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- CSRF with limited impact
- Insecure direct object references

#### 🟢 Low
- Missing security headers
- Verbose error messages
- Minor information leakage
- Rate limiting issues

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **🔐 Authentication**: Bearer token authentication for admin access
- **🛡️ Rate Limiting**: Configurable request rate limiting
- **🔒 Security Headers**: Helmet.js security headers
- **✅ Input Validation**: Server-side input validation and sanitization
- **🌐 CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS policies
- **📊 Audit Logging**: Comprehensive request and action logging

### 🔧 Security Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```env
# Security Configuration
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000      # 15 minutes

CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
SSL_KEY_PATH=./ssl/private.key
SSL_CERT_PATH=./ssl/certificate.crt
```

#### Recommended Security Settings
- Use strong admin tokens (minimum 32 characters)
- Enable SSL/HTTPS in production
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Set up rate limiting appropriate for your traffic
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
